                <i>Study in Hands</i> by Théophile Gautier
                </p>
                
                I
                
                <i>Imperia</i>
                
                <p>
                I saw a plaster hand, on view
                In sculptor’s studio, set apart ...
                Aspasia’s? Cleopatra’s? ... Who?
                This fragment’s human work of art
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Like lily silvered by the dawn,
                Frozen in kiss of snow, its light
                Loveliness dazzled me, and shone
                In poetry of purest white.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Though pallid, wan, yet striking, it
                Spread over velvet, graceful, slender
                Fingers—delicate, exquisite—
                Decked thick with rings of weighty splendor.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Thumb high, in serpentine-like pose,
                Arched in a svelte and shapely line,
                It lay, fine set, like one of those
                Hands held with proud air Florentine.
                </p>
                    
                <p>    
                Did it comb out the sultan’s beard
                On jeweled caftan? Or, with twirls
                And twistings, when Don Juan appeared,
                Play in his lustrous, glistening curls?
                </p>
                   
                <p>
                A courtesan’s? A queen’s? Did this
                Wrought hand a scepter wield? Which one?
                The paragon of fleshly bliss?
                Sovereignty’s beauteous paragon?
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Doubtless, by little starts and fits,
                It lit, poised, in its fluttering,
                On the she-lion croup of its
                Chimera-dream, caught on the wing;
                </p>
                    
                <p>    
                The Empire’s fantasies; bombastic
                Love of fantastic, sumptuous schemes;
                Voluptuous frenzies orgiastic;
                Impossible and futile dreams;
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Wild tales; poetic escapades
                Of hashish, Rhine-wine sorcery;
                Dashing Bohemian cavalcades
                On steeds unbridled, coursing free...
                </p>
                   
                <p>
                Such are the things the eyes divines
                In that white book, by Venus written:
                Blank palm where she has traced the signs
                One reads, a-tremble, terror-smitten
                </p>
