                <i>Study in Hands</i> by Théophile Gautier
                </p>
                
                <p>
                I<br>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                <i>Imperia</i><br>

                <p>
                I saw a plaster hand, on view<br>
                In sculptor’s studio, set apart ...<br>
                Aspasia’s? Cleopatra’s? ... Who?<br>
                This fragment’s human work of art<br>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Like lily silvered by the dawn,<br>
                Frozen in kiss of snow, its light<br>
                Loveliness dazzled me, and shone<br>
                In poetry of purest white.<br>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Though pallid, wan, yet striking, it<br>
                Spread over velvet, graceful, slender<br>
                Fingers—delicate, exquisite—<br>
                Decked thick with rings of weighty splendor.<br>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Thumb high, in serpentine-like pose,<br>
                Arched in a svelte and shapely line,<br>
                It lay, fine set, like one of those<br>
                Hands held with proud air Florentine.<br>
                </p>
                    
                <p>    
                Did it comb out the sultan’s beard<br>
                On jeweled caftan? Or, with twirls<br>
                And twistings, when Don Juan appeared,<br>
                Play in his lustrous, glistening curls?<br>
                </p>
                   
                <p>
                A courtesan’s? A queen’s? Did this<br>
                Wrought hand a scepter wield? Which one?<br>
                The paragon of fleshly bliss?<br>
                Sovereignty’s beauteous paragon?<br>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Doubtless, by little starts and fits,<br>
                It lit, poised, in its fluttering,<br>
                On the she-lion croup of its<br>
                Chimera-dream, caught on the wing;<br>
                </p>
                    
                <p>    
                The Empire’s fantasies; bombastic<br>
                Love of fantastic, sumptuous schemes;<br>
                Voluptuous frenzies orgiastic;<br>
                Impossible and futile dreams;<br>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                Wild tales; poetic escapades<br>
                Of hashish, Rhine-wine sorcery;<br>
                Dashing Bohemian cavalcades<br>
                On steeds unbridled, coursing free...<br>
                </p>
                   
                <p>
                Such are the things the eyes divines<br>
                In that white book, by Venus written:<br>
                Blank palm where she has traced the signs<br>
                One reads, a-tremble, terror-smitten<br>
